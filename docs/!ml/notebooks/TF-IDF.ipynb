    "                          Only this, and nothing more.”\n",
    " Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,\n",
    " And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.\n",
    " Eagerly I wished the morrow;—vainly I had sought to borrow\n",
    " From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—\n",
    " For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\n",
    "                          Nameless here for evermore.\n",
    " And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain\n",
    " Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\n",
    " So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n",
    " “‘Tis some visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door—\n",
    " Some late visiter entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\n",
    "                          This it is, and nothing more.”\n",
    " Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n",
    " “Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\n",
    " But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\n",
    " And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\n",
    " That I scarce was sure I heard you “—here I opened wide the door;——\n",
    "                          Darkness there and nothing more.\n",
    " Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\n",
    " Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\n",
    " But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no token,\n",
    " And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore!”\n",
    "  This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\n",
    "                          Merely this, and nothing more.\n",
    " Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\n",
    " Soon I heard again a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n",
    " “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\n",
    " Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\n",
    " Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n",
    "                          ‘Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n",
    " Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\n",
    " In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore;\n",
    " Not the least obeisance made he; not an instant stopped or stayed he;\n",
    " But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\n",
    " Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\n",
    "                          Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\n",
    " Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\n",
    " By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n",
    " “Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\n",
    " Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\n",
    " Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\n",
    "                          Quoth the raven “Nevermore.”\n",
    " Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\n",
    " Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\n",
    " For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\n",
    " Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\n",
    " Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\n",
    "                         With such name as “Nevermore.”\n",
    " But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\n",
    " That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\n",
    " Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\n",
    " Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\n",
    " On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before.”\n",
    "                          Then the bird said “Nevermore.”\n",
    " Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n",
    " “Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\n",
    " Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\n",
    " Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\n",
    " Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\n",
    "                         Of “Never—nevermore.”\n",
    " But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,\n",
    " Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\n",
    " Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to thinking\n",
    " Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\n",
    " What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore\n",
    "                         Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n",
    " This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\n",
    " To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\n",
    " This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\n",
    " On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamplght gloated o’er,\n",
    " But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloating o’er,\n",
    "                          She shall press, ah, nevermore!\n",
    " Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\n",
    " Swung by Angels whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n",
    " “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent\n",
    " thee\n",
    " Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\n",
    " Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\n",
    "                           Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”\n",
    " “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\n",
    " Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\n",
    " Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\n",
    " On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\n",
    " Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\n",
    "                           Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”\n",
    " “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil—prophet still, if bird or devil!\n",
    " By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\n",
    " Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\n",
    " It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\n",
    " Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\n",
    "                           Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”\n",
    " “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n",
    " “Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\n",

    "                          Quoth the raven, “Nevermore.”\n",
