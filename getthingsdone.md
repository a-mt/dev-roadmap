One of the positive psychological benefits of systematic exercise is the **development of a sense of personal mastery and positive self-regard**, which we believe is likely to play some role in the depression-reducing effects of exercise. In other words, exercise confirms your new identity to yourself. It changes the type of person that you believe that you are and proves that you can become better. 

It doesn't matter if you're battling depression, working to lose weight, or trying to create work that matters. **Your identity - the type of person that you believe that you are - is what dictates how far you'll go in any endeavor**. It proves a new identity to yourself. Each time you finish a workout, you reap the benefits of an increased sense of self-confidence. The cumulative impact of these "small wins" is enormous.

If you're struggling with depression, then the application of this should be obvious. But even if you consider yourself to be a happy person, the principle of proving your identity to yourself can apply to virtually any goal you want to achieve. **Pick a daily habit that will strengthen your sense of self-worth and solidify your identity**. For example, you could try meditation, exercise, writing, or creating art.

Whatever you choose, pick it now, start small, and begin proving to yourself that you can become the type of person you want to become. **Tiny habits, when repeated consistently, can be the difference success or failure, confidence or doubt, and even happiness or depression.**

The key to building lasting habits is focusing on creating a new identity first. Your current behaviors are simply a reflection of your current identity. What you do now is a mirror image of the type of person you believe that you are (either consciously or subconsciously).

The reason why it's so hard to stick to new habits is that we often try to achieve a performance or appearance-based goal without changing our identity. Most of the time we try to achieve results before proving to ourselves that we have the identity of the type of person we want to become. It should be the other way around.

Changing your beliefs isn’t nearly as hard as you might think. **There are two steps**.

1. **Decide the type of person you want to be.**
2. **Prove it to yourself with small wins.**

Want to lose weight? Identity: Become the type of person who moves more every day. Small win: Buy a pedometer. Walk 50 steps when you get home from work. Tomorrow, walk 100 steps. The day after that, 150 steps. If you do this 5 days per week and add 50 steps each day, then by the end of the year, you’ll be walking over 10,000 steps per day.

Want to become a better writer? Identity: Become the type of person who writes 1,000 words every day. Small win: Write one paragraph each day this week.

If you're looking to make a change, then I say **stop worrying about results and start worrying about your identity. Become the type of person who can achieve the things you want to achieve. Build the habit now. The results can come later.**
